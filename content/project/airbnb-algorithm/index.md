Notes:

Project overview: Understanding how AirBnb's search algorithm is aligned with user perspectives.

Process:

1. Identify current filters and features

- Identified available features to filter, researched recommendation algorithm

2. Identify target population and constrains

- Individuals residing in the US

- Accommodation in the US

- College graduate students and young professionals

4. Initial user interviews with 2 individuals to talk over filter features 

- discussed combining features that were relevant (e.g., smoke alarm and carbon monoxide alarm)

- identified uncertainty in features (e.g., what is considered "breakfast")

5. Define set list of target features

- Decisions were made

- Keep certain items together: air conditioning and heating; washer and dryer

- Excluded accessibility features - through discussion with others, decided to exclude as do not want to overshadow accessibility needs when using the general population



**Goals**

Identify which AirBnb listing features/characteristics that are most or least important when selecting accommodation

Identify whether users' perceived feature importance matches the current algorithm (as outlined on their website).

**Why MaxDiff?**

Good discrimination among items - forces individuals to make a choice between multiple items rather than potentially rating everything as 4 or 5 out of 5 for importance.

Reduces scale use bias



Procedure:

Initially interviewed 2 individuals on features they would find comparable using the AirBnb filtering features plus features utilized in their own algorithm scheme.

Cognitive walkthrough when pilot testing the survey - identify areas of confusion and add explanations at the start of the survey

"When you are considering Airbnb accommodation options within the US, **which one of the following 5 features is the LEAST important for you and which one feature is the MOST important to you?**"
