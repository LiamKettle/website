Notes:

Project overview: Understanding how AirBnb's search algorithm is aligned with user perspectives.

# Process:

## Identify current filters and features

* Identified available features to filter, researched recommendation algorithm

## Identify target population and constrains

* Individuals residing in the US

* Accommodation in the US

* College graduate students and young professionals

##Initial user interviews with 2 individuals to talk over filter features 

* discussed combining features that were relevant (e.g., smoke alarm and carbon monoxide alarm)

* identified uncertainty in features (e.g., what is considered "breakfast")

## Define set list of target features

* Decisions were made

* Keep certain items together: air conditioning and heating; washer and dryer

* Excluded accessibility features - through discussion with others, decided to exclude as do not want to overshadow accessibility needs when using the general population

**Goals**

* Identify which AirBnb listing features/characteristics that are most or least important when selecting accommodation

* Identify whether users' perceived feature importance matches the current algorithm (as outlined on their website).

**Why MaxDiff?**

* Good discrimination among items - forces individuals to make a choice between multiple items rather than potentially rating everything as 4 or 5 out of 5 for importance.

* Reduces scale use bias


# AirBnb's Recommendation Algorithm

AirBnb is transparent about which features they use for their recommendation algorithm. Therefore, I used their specified features as comparisons. Three key characteristics are heavily prominent in their algorithm: **Quality, popularity,** and **price.** 

> **Quality.** The algorithm assesses many characteristics to evaluate quality, including the **listing photos, reviews of the listing, and listing characteristics.** Higher quality listings tend to rank higher in search.
> **Popularity.** The algorithm evaluates the popularity of a listing using a wide range of information, including **how guests engage with the listing** and **how often the listing gets booked.** Examples of guest engagement with a listing include how often guests save a listing to their wish list, how often guests book, and **how often guests message the Host.** More popular listings tend to rank higher in search.
> **Price.** To determine how attractive the price of a listing is, the algorithm considers a variety of price data, including **how the price compares to similar listings** in the area for the given dates. Listings that are priced below other comparable listings—other listings in the area with similar guest capacity and amenities—tend to rank higher in search.

Other factors that influence search results:
* Location
* High quality listing photos
* Accurate list of amenities
* Superhost status
* Instant booking
* Guest influence



# Procedure:

* Initially interviewed 2 individuals on features they would find comparable using the AirBnb filtering features plus features utilized in their own algorithm scheme.

* Cognitive walkthrough when pilot testing the survey - identify areas of confusion and add explanations at the start of the survey

"When you are considering Airbnb accommodation options within the US, **which one of the following 5 features is the LEAST important for you and which one feature is the MOST important to you?**"


| | Listed Features for Comparison | |
| - | - | - |
| Number of reviews | Accommodation rating | Price |
| Instant book | Self check-in | (Clothes) Iron |
| Air conditioning / Heating | Dedicated workspace | Hair dryer |
| Kitchen | TV | Washer / Dryer |
| Wifi | Free parking | Hot tub |
| Indoor fireplace | Pool | Smoking allowed |
| Host language | Distance from the desired area | High quality listing photos |
| Airbnb plus | Smoke alarm and/or carbon monoxide alarm | Superhost |


# Maxdiff survey

Participants were randomly presented 5 of the 24 features and asked to select their most important and least important features. There were 14 sets.


# Results



# Conclusions


# Reflection

* Qualtrics is good for learning MaxDiff, but not for applying under their basic subscription. Next time, I would trial Sawtooth Software given their survey tools specific to conjoint analysis.
