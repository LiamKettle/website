Food delivery applications are widespread in modern-day society. However, these applications must adapt to the constantly changing needs of its users. Thus, for a UX research project for my Usability and Product design course, my team evaluated the usability of food delivery applications, then prototyped and user-tested design iterations utilizing the research insights. 
Disclaimer: The presentation provided is our group presentation at the end of the course; however, our team decided to proceed with user testing and further prototyping after the course. Therefore, the presentation does not contain information regarding user testing and the second prototype.
