Food delivery applications are widespread in modern-day society. However, these applications must adapt to the constantly changing needs of its users. Thus, for a UX research project for my Usability and Product design course, my team evaluated the usability of food delivery applications, then prototyped and user-tested design iterations utilizing the research insights. 
Disclaimer: The presentation provided is our group presentation at the end of the course; however, our team decided to proceed with user testing and further prototyping after the course. Therefore, the presentation does not contain information regarding user testing and the second prototype.

**Background**

As part of our Usability and Product Design class, we were tasked to evaluate and improve a given product. For this project, we chose to evaluate the usability of three main food delivery applications (FDA) - DoorDash, Grubhub, and Uber Eats. 

**Goals:**

* Compare the usability of different food delivery applications
* Identify target users' frustration across the FDAs
* Explore recommended areas of improvement
* Evaluate a novel prototype based on the recommendations

**Method**

To better understand who our target users were, we created three **personas** each identifying their motivations and uses for using FDAs. 

Next, we conducted a **task analysis** to reconstruct users’ journeys from restaurant selection to reviewing their orders. 

After the task procedure was solidified, we conducted a **competitor analysis** to identify the strengths and weaknesses of each FDA in satisfying the overall task. 

Complimenting this analysis, the research term conducted **heuristic evaluations** for each sub-task to identify areas for improvement and provide insight for potential recommendations.

After identifying our initial recommendations, we each created **pen-and-paper wireframes**, then discussed which features were most appropriate before designing a **low-fidelity prototype**. Here, we presented our initial findings and prototype with our cohort members. 

Continuing with our project, we conducted **user testing** utilizing **surveys** to understand participants’ background and their context of use and **think-aloud testing** to observe and identify areas of confusion. After collating the data and evolving our recommendations, we developed a **medium-fidelity** prototype that addressed participants’ pain points.

Overall, we were able to clearly understand the needs of our users and develop a prototype that enhanced the usability of restaurant/food selection, group ordering, and rating the food delivery and service. Note, our initial prototype is shown in the presentation slides; the final prototype can be viewed in the figma link below.

**Recommendations**

* Design a multi-restaurant filtering option to improve ease of use
* More convenient group ordering and split payment system that considers distinctive single- and group -order factors influencing overall usage
* A food and delivery review interface that allows multiple feedback options and scrolling requirements

**Lessons learned**

* Asking participants to share their screens alongside audio recordings to assist virtual usability testing. Although this was primarily a factor during COVID-19, this extends to all virtual usability testing.
* Facilitating consistency during user testing, create a readily accessible quick reference sheet with open-ended questions for participants. The reference sheet is useful for cases where participants do not provide enough verbal feedback while interacting with the app.
* If the participant is quiet throughout the walkthrough, do not be afraid to stop them and ask questions about the screen they interacted with most recently.
