Each year, HFES invites students to participate in the Mobile Health Applications for End Users design competition in conjunction with the 2022 International Symposium on Human Factors and Ergonomics in Health Care. The objectives are to (1) showcase the application of human factors/ergonomics (HF/E) methods and design principles to the design of a mobile health application for consumers (healthcare recipients) or their nonprofessional support network (informal caregivers and community); and (2) showcase how the HF/E approach to such an application can lead to a useful, usable, and satisfying user experience while simultaneously improving patient outcomes such as knowledge, safety, adherence, or health.

Objective
Throughout this competition, our team designed Ascent, an application that would allow universities to provide their students with an affordable resource that incorporates mental health, well-being, and socialization from both an AI assistant and community support. When considering the design of this application, we aimed to address several concerns related to the mental health and well-being of young adults in college. Additionally, this design sought to lessen the impact of issues that have arisen due to COVID-19 measures including reduced access to therapy, feelings of social isolation, lessened wellbeing, and increased symptoms of mental illness.
