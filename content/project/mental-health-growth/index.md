Each year, HFES invites students to participate in the Mobile Health Applications for End Users design competition in conjunction with the 2022 International Symposium on Human Factors and Ergonomics in Health Care. The objectives are to (1) showcase the application of human factors/ergonomics (HF/E) methods and design principles to the design of a mobile health application for consumers (healthcare recipients) or their nonprofessional support network (informal caregivers and community); and (2) showcase how the HF/E approach to such an application can lead to a useful, usable, and satisfying user experience while simultaneously improving patient outcomes such as knowledge, safety, adherence, or health.

**Objective**
Throughout this competition, our team designed Ascent, an application that would allow universities to provide their students with an affordable resource that incorporates mental health, well-being, and socialization from both an AI assistant and community support. When considering the design of this application, we aimed to address several concerns related to the mental health and well-being of young adults in college. Additionally, this design sought to lessen the impact of issues that have arisen due to COVID-19 measures including reduced access to therapy, feelings of social isolation, lessened wellbeing, and increased symptoms of mental illness. 

**Method**
We employed human-centered design methods to develop Ascent to serve the needs of the young student population. More specifically, we created:
***Personas** to identify and understand our target users' needs and motivations
***Task and competitor analyses** to identify users' main goals and evaluate the efficacy of relevant apps in addressing these goals, and then
***User testing** utilizing concurrent think aloud procedures and qualitative user data to identify common user experience themes. 
After this process, we then designed the prototype application, Ascent, using Figma. 

**Practical Impact**
We believe that Ascent addressed many concerns young students have regarding mental health during university studies, especially while navigating COVID-19. In particular, Ascent addressed accessibility concerns during a time where traditional resources may be less accessible due to the impact of COVID-19 or financial reasons. Furthermore, Ascent would provide an avenue for students to get some social interaction and hold themselves accountable for their wellness goals. As Ascent does not rely on direct services from healthcare professionals, the application can be scaled to reach any size of population, from a single user to an entire student body.
