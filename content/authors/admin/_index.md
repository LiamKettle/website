:wave: Welcome! I'm a **UX** and **Human Factors Researcher** currently pursuing a PhD in Human Factors and Applied Cognition at George Mason University. I am passionate about accessible communication and enhancing system transparency with dedication to both qualitative and quantitative end-to-end research designs.

My research focuses on understanding user-centric perceptions and attitudes across surface transportation, well-being, AI, and product design. 

Accessible well-being chatbots
In-vehicle advanced communication systems

My research diverges into three domains:


:oncoming_automobile: Transparent vehicle-human communication


:heart: Accessible well-being chatbots
