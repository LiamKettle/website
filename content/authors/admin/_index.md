:wave: Welcome! I'm a **UX** and **Human Factors Researcher**. I recently defended my Human Factors PhD at George Mason University (**yay!**). I am passionate about **accessible communication** and **enhancing system transparency** for users with dedication to both qualitative and quantitative end-to-end research designs.

My research diverges into three domains: <br>
:oncoming_automobile: Transparent vehicle-human communication <br>
:heart: Accessible well-being AI chatbots <br>
:iphone: Enhancing product design
