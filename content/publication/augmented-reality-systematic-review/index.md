abstract: Capabilities for automated driving system (ADS)-equipped vehicles have
  been expanding over the past decade. Research has explored integrating
  augmented reality (AR) interfaces in ADS-equipped vehicles to improve drivers’
  situational awareness, performance, and trust. This paper systematically
  reviewed AR visualizations for in-vehicle vehicle-driver communication from
  2012 to 2022. The review first identified meta-data and methodological trends
  before aggregating findings from distinct AR interfaces and corresponding
  subjective and objective measures. Prominent subjective measures included
  acceptance, trust, and user experience; objective measures comprised various
  driving behavior or eye-tracking metrics. Research more often evaluated
  simulated AR interfaces, presented through windshields, and communicated
  object detection or intended maneuvers, in level 2 ADS. For object detection,
  key visualizations included bounding shapes, highlighting, or symbols. For
  intended route, mixed results were found for world-fixed verse screen-fixed
  arrows. Regardless of the AR design, communicating the ADS’ actions or
  environmental elements was beneficial to drivers, though presenting clear,
  relevant information was more favorable. Gaps in the literature that yet to be
  addressed include longitudinal effects, impaired visibility, contextual user
  needs, system reliability, and, most notably, inclusive design. Regardless,
  the review supports that integrating AR interfaces in ADS-equipped vehicles
  can lead to higher trust, acceptance, and safer driving performances.
