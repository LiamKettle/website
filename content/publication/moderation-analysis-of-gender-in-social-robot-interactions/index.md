abstract: The current study aimed to further analyze Schadenberg et al.’s (2021)
  dataset examining perceived social attributions after observing human-robot
  interactions. In their study, visibility of an external cause was found to
  significantly predict perceived competence of the Robot Social Attributes
  Scale (RoSAS) only. However, no demographic variable was considered in the
  analyzes. Therefore, gender was analyzed as a moderator between visibility and
  participants’ perceived competence of the robot. Additionally, a Confirmatory
  Factor Analysis was conducted on the RoSAS measure to examine its validity in
  the current context. Results indicated that gender did not significantly
  moderate the relationship between visibility and perceived competence. This
  finding could be explained by the RoSAS demonstrating poor fit with the data
  even though the measure indicated high internal reliability. In light of these
  results, the current study advocates for further psychometric validation of
  newer scales across varying conditions, especially within the social robotics
  field.
