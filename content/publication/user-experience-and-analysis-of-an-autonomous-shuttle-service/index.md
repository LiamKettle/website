abstract: As the use of autonomous vehicles for public transportation becomes
  more prevalent, it is important to examine characteristics of potential users
  and their perception of the service. This study aimed to capture user opinions
  and feedback from both riders and non-riders concerning an autonomous shuttle
  service. Potential differences in user groups were examined as well, comparing
  employees of the Department of Defense to civilian users. Participants
  generally held positive opinions about the shuttle, although riders were more
  likely to rate the service favourably. Civilian users were also more likely to
  rate the shuttle favourably and more often claimed that they would recommend
  it to others. The youngest participants tended to report higher levels of
  agreement and acceptance on perceived safety and intelligence as well as the
  shuttleâ€™s avoidance of obstacles and obedience of traffic rules. Research in
  this area has implications for all facets of the transportation industry as
  well as future users of autonomous public transportation.
