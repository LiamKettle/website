abstract: "As vehicle automation capabilities increase, driving control shifts
  from the human to the vehicle system. However, concerns arise regarding
  responsibility following critical events and the publics’ trust and acceptance
  of vehicles equipped with automated driving systems (ADS). The current study
  examined how participants assigned blame and praise to ADS-equipped vehicles
  and human drivers following collisions or near-misses and how these
  attributions were impacted by a virtual driving assistant that administered
  monitoring requests. Based on literature, our primary hypothesis was that more
  blame would be assigned to the human and more praise assigned to the ADS when
  the driving assistant was present. Additionally, we hypothesized greater
  reported trust towards ADS-equipped vehicles when the driving assistant was
  present. Participants read vignettes of automated driving, watched
  corresponding videos, and then self-reported trust, acceptance,
  anthropomorphism, and assignment of blame and praise. All hypotheses were
  supported indicating that significant effects were observed: participants
  assigned greater blame to the human when asked to actively monitor the driving
  environment and assigned greater praise to the ADS when it alerted the human
  driver. Additionally, participants reported greater trust and anthropomorphism
  of the ADS when the driving assistant was present. These findings suggest that
  explicitly communicating monitoring responsibility through a driving assistant
  significantly impacts the publics’ opinion of responsibility following
  critical events. These findings provide initial support for a solution to
  improve driver safety as well as policy implications regarding positive
  perceptions and the adoption of ADS-equipped vehicles."
