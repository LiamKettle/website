abstract: University students tend to sacrifice healthy lifestyles in favor of
  academic and financial gain. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has led to
  online schooling and reduced access to healthcare resources. To mitigate these
  pressures, artificial intelligence conversational agents (CA) have addressed
  mental wellness in the general population but are yet to address physical
  well-being. Therefore, a CA that can address barriers and improve physical and
  mental well-being by cultivating healthy behaviors is desired. This research
  is designed to evaluate the feasibility and user experience of a text-based CA
  on addressing student barriers for a healthy lifestyle using evidence-based
  theories including the Theory of Planned Behavior and Motivational
  Interviewing over a two-week timeframe. Data collection has been paused due to
  the pandemic; results are expected to show positive impacts on well-being
  outcomes compared to an information-only control group and support the
  implementation of CAs to those with less accessibility to healthcare
  resources.
