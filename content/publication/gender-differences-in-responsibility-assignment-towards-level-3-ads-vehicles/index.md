abstract: Numerous collisions have occurred since integrating vehicles with
  automated driving system (ADS) features. Attributed responsibility following
  collisions differ dependent on level of automation or anthropomorphism.
  However, gender differences are yet to be examined. Thus, the current study
  examined gender differences in responsibility assignment following collisions
  involving an ADS-equipped vehicle and the influence of a driving assistant
  (DA) that administered monitoring requests. Participants read hypothetical
  scenarios and watched corresponding simulated videos with or without the DA
  present before assigning blame to the human or the ADS. Hypotheses included
  gender differences in overall blame assignment, and interaction effects
  between gender and DA presence; gender and agent; and gender, DA presence, and
  agent. Results indicated gender differences when assigning responsibility to
  the human agent only. No other significant differences were supported
  indicating that men and women generally attribute blame similarly. However,
  further demographic differences (e.g., age, socio-economic status) should be
  explored.
