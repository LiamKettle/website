abstract: Vehicle manufacturers are advancing their automated driving system
  (ADS) capabilities with enhanced transparency features. Research supports
  driving assistants (DA) and augmented reality (AR) displays for conveying the
  ADS status, actions, and road environment elements. However, providing
  continuous or irrelevant information degrades driving performance and
  attitudes towards the ADS. Therefore, the current study sought to create a
  framework for specific communication features that would enhance drivers’
  trust and situation awareness via DA and AR stimuli. Participants watched
  various driving scenarios and provided their desired communication features to
  improve trust and situation awareness across modalities. Results identified
  key themes consistent across events (i.e., current/intended vehicle actions)
  as well as context-dependent themes such as police presence or pedestrian
  detection and location. In contrast, auditory cues were identified as
  redundant across events. These findings can support researchers to focus on
  relevant information to enhance drivers’ attitudes, awareness, and safety
  while operating ADS-equipped vehicles.

summary: I conducted this project to explore specific driving-related features
  that individuals desire to be communicated to them while operating an
  autonomous vehicle. An initial framework for traffic-light-related events will
  be presented at the 67th Human Factors and Ergonomics Society Conference.
