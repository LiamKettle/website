abstract: Vehicles with autonomous features are more prevalent in today’s
  society, though as the level of autonomation increases, so does the vehicle
  system’s control of the vehicle. As the driving control shifts from human to
  the vehicle system, concerns arise regarding the attribution of responsibility
  and blame following critical events (e.g., collisions or near-misses). In this
  work-in-progress study, we aim to understand how the public attributes blame
  and praise to both humans and autonomous vehicles (AVs) following critical
  events. In addition, we examine how an AI driving assistant that administers
  Monitoring Requests influences blame and praise attributions. Furthermore, we
  examine differences in acceptance, trust, and perceived anthropomorphism
  between an AV with and without an AI driving assistant. Preliminary results
  are provided followed by a discussion of the expected results and potential
  impact for research and legal issues
